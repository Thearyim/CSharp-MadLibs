    <h1>A Day at the Zoo!</h1>
    <p>Today I went to the zoo. I saw a @Model.GetAdjective1()
    @Model.GetNoun1() jumping up and down in its tree. He
    @Model.GetVerb1() @Model.GetAdverb1() through
    the large tunnel that led to its @Model.GetAdjective2()
    @Model.GetNoun2(). I got some peanuts and passed them
    through the cage to a gigantic gray @Model.GetNoun3()
    towering above my head. Feeding that animal made me
    hungry. I went to get a @Model.GetAdjective3() scoop of ice
    cream. It filled my stomach. Afterwards I had to
    @Model.GetVerb2() @Model.GetAdverb2() to catch our bus. When
    I got home I @Model.GetVerb3() my mom for a
    @Model.GetAdjective4() day at the zoo.</p>
